# Algorithms, Datastructures and Code Challenges

This is a repo of algorithms and data structures for self study.

The solutions are organized by langauges and then algorithm/data structure.

The code challenges are organized by their origin (hackerrank, leet code, code wars, etc) and then their programming langauge. The code challenges that use data sctrucutures import them from their respective folders. 

## Langauges and Testing

C language uses the [cGreen](https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen) testing framwork

Typescript and javascript use [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) and [chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai)

Python uses [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
