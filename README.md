# ⚗️ Algorithms, Datastructures and Code Challenges

This is a repo of that organizes my algorithms and data structures for self study.

It mainly contains links to other repos and my todo list.

The solutions are organized by langauges and then algorithm/data structure and linked to the corrosponding repos

The code challenges are organized by their origin (hackerrank, leet code, code wars, etc) and then their programming langauge.

## Langauges and Testing

testing is done with the [makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). In all cases you can run the tests with the command `make run_tests`.

* C language uses the [cGreen](https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen) testing framwork
* Typescript and javascript use [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) and [chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) 
* Python uses [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
