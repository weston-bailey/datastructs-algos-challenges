# ⚗️ Algorithms, Datastructures and Code Challenges

This is a repo of that organizes my algorithms and data structures for self study.

The algorithms/data structures are organized by language.

The code challenges are organized by their origin (hackerrank, leet code, code wars, etc) and then their programming langauge.

## Languages and Testing

testing is done with the [makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). In all cases you can run the tests with the command `make run_tests`.

C language uses the [cGreen](https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen) testing framework

* C language uses the [cGreen](https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen) testing framwork
* Typescript and javascript use [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) and [chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) 
* Python uses [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
* gonna do [something like this](http://www.jimlynchcodes.com/blog/a-tdd-with-typescript-setup-guide) for typescript haha
